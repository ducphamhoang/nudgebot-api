I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

I analyzed the current codebase and found that the essential test suite infrastructure already exists but isn't fully integrated. The `test-essential` target exists in the Makefile with proper dependencies, the essential tests are well-organized in `/test/essential/` with comprehensive coverage, and the CI/CD pipeline has the necessary services (PostgreSQL, Redis) already configured. The main gaps are: `test-all` doesn't include essential tests, README.md lacks essential test documentation, and the CI pipeline doesn't run essential tests.

### Approach

The implementation will focus on three key integration points: updating the Makefile's `test-all` target to include essential tests, enhancing the README.md testing documentation with a dedicated essential test suite section, and extending the existing CI/CD integration-tests job to run essential tests. This approach leverages existing infrastructure and maintains consistency with current patterns while ensuring essential tests are executed reliably in both local development and CI environments.

### Reasoning

I examined the repository structure and identified the relevant files mentioned by the user. I read the current Makefile to understand the test target structure and found that `test-essential` already exists but isn't included in `test-all`. I analyzed the README.md testing section to understand the documentation structure and identify where essential test documentation should be added. I reviewed the CI/CD pipeline configuration to understand how tests are currently executed and determined the best approach for integrating essential tests without disrupting existing workflows.

## Proposed File Changes

### Makefile(MODIFY)

Update the `test-all` target dependencies to include `test-essential` alongside the existing `test-unit` and `test-integration` targets. The target is currently at line 137 and should be modified from `test-all: test-unit test-integration` to `test-all: test-unit test-integration test-essential`. Additionally, update the help documentation section around line 384 where `test-all` is described as "Run all tests (unit + integration)" to "Run all tests (unit + integration + essential)" to accurately reflect the new behavior. No other changes are needed since the `test-essential` target already exists with proper dependencies (`ensure-deps` and `generate-mocks`) and the `.PHONY` declaration already includes all necessary targets.

### README.md(MODIFY)

Add a new subsection titled "### 🎯 Essential Test Suite" after the existing "### 🎯 Test Structure" section (around line 261) and before the "## 🔧 Development" section. This new section should document the purpose of the essential test suite (comprehensive integration testing with deterministic execution order) and provide command examples in fenced code blocks with bash syntax highlighting. Include commands for `make test-essential` (all essential tests), `make test-essential-suite` (deterministic master suite), `make test-essential-flows` (end-to-end flow tests), `make test-essential-services` (service integration tests), and `make test-essential-reliability` (error handling tests). Add a note that essential tests use testcontainers and require Docker to be running. Also update the existing "### 🏃 Running Tests" section around line 224 to change the comment for `make test-all` from "Run all tests" to "Run all tests (unit + integration + essential)". Review and update any other sections that reference `test-all` to reflect that it now includes essential tests, particularly in the "### 🛠️ Available Make Commands" section (lines 320-375) and "### 🔄 Development Workflow" section (lines 294-318).

### .github/workflows/ci.yml(MODIFY)

Add a new step to the `integration-tests` job after the existing "🔧 Run integration tests" step (around line 221). The new step should be named "🎯 Run essential tests" and should execute `make test-essential`. Use the same environment variables as the integration tests step: `TEST_DB_HOST: localhost`, `TEST_DB_PORT: 5433`, `TEST_DB_USER: test_user`, `TEST_DB_PASSWORD: test_pass`, `TEST_DB_NAME: test_nudgebot`, `TEST_REDIS_HOST: localhost`, `TEST_REDIS_PORT: 6380`, and `ENV: test`. This approach reuses the existing PostgreSQL and Redis services that are already configured in the job, avoiding the need to duplicate service setup or modify job dependencies. The current 25-minute timeout for the integration-tests job should be sufficient since the essential test suite has a maximum timeout of 15 minutes according to the Makefile configuration.
