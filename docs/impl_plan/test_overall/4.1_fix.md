Update all service constructor calls in `test/essential/flows/` and `test/essential/services/` to match the actual service APIs used in `message_flow_test.go`. Replace `chatbot.NewService()` with `chatbot.NewChatbotServiceWithProvider()`, fix scheduler constructor calls, and ensure all mock initializations follow the established patterns.

Fix all import paths in `test/essential/` to match the actual codebase structure. Remove imports to non-existent `internal/mocks` package and replace with proper mock implementations. Verify all external package imports are correct and available.

Update package declarations in all files under `test/essential/services/` to use the original service package names instead of `package services`. This ensures proper access to internal service functionality during testing.

Move failure tests that not important and essential to docs/impl_plan/test_overall/4.1_test_failure.md for later checks.

Make sure essential tests working
