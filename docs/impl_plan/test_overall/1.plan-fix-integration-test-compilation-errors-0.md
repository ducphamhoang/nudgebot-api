I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

I analyzed the codebase and found that both `integration_test.go` and `integration_test_fixed.go` exist in the root directory with duplicate function and type declarations. This causes Go compilation errors when running `go build ./...` due to "redeclared in this block" errors for symbols like `TestEventDrivenIntegration`, `setupMockNudgeService`, `mockLLMServiceIntegration`, and helper functions. The fixed version contains additional test cases and improved assertions, while no other files in the codebase reference the unique symbols from the old file.

### Approach

The solution is straightforward: delete the obsolete `integration_test.go` file entirely since `integration_test_fixed.go` contains the corrected and enhanced version of all functionality. This will resolve the duplicate declaration compilation errors while preserving the improved test coverage. The Makefile's `test-unit` target only runs tests in subdirectories (`./internal/...`, `./api/...`, `./pkg/...`), so it's unaffected by root-level test files. After deletion, verify compilation with `go build ./...` and run `make test-unit` to ensure the unit test suite passes.

### Reasoning

I examined the repository structure and read the relevant files mentioned in the user's request. I compared both integration test files to identify duplicate declarations causing compilation conflicts. I verified that the Makefile's test targets work independently of root-level test files and confirmed that no other codebase files depend on symbols unique to the old integration test file.

## Proposed File Changes

### integration_test.go(DELETE)

References: 

- integration_test_fixed.go

Delete the entire file to resolve duplicate declaration compilation errors. This file contains obsolete integration test code that has been superseded by the corrected version in `integration_test_fixed.go`. The file contains duplicate symbols including:

- `TestEventDrivenIntegration` function (conflicts with same function in `integration_test_fixed.go`)
- `setupMockNudgeService` and `setupMockLLMService` helper functions (duplicated)
- `mockLLMServiceIntegration` type and its methods (duplicated)
- `extractTaskTitle` and `containsDateHint` helper functions (duplicated)

These duplicates cause Go compilation errors when both files are present in the same package. The enhanced version in `integration_test_fixed.go` provides all the same functionality plus additional test cases for error handling and concurrent processing.

No other files in the codebase reference the unique symbols from this file, making it safe to delete without breaking dependencies.
