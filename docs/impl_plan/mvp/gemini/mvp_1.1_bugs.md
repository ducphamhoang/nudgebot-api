## Fixed Issues

✅ **GetSuggestions method**: The `GetSuggestions` method already exists in both the `LLMService` interface and the `mockLLMService` struct in `internal/llm/service_test.go`. The mock implementation matches the real service interface.

✅ **ValidateEventStructure function**: The `ValidateEventStructure` function already exists in `internal/events/integration.go` and is properly implemented.

✅ **Event types**: All event types referenced in `internal/events/mock_bus.go` are properly defined in `internal/events/types.go`. Event types include MessageReceived, TaskParsed, TaskCreated, etc.

✅ **NewEvent function**: The `NewEvent()` function already exists in `internal/events/types.go` and returns a base Event struct with generated correlation ID and timestamp.

✅ **Handlers test file**: Created `api/handlers/handlers_test.go` with basic test structure that uses local mocks following the same pattern as other test files.

✅ **Enhanced mock repository**: The enhanced mock repository already uses the `SetError(operation, error)` pattern for consistent error handling.

✅ **mockgen dependency**: Added `github.com/golang/mock` dependency to the `go.mod` file as specified in the task requirements.

## Remaining Recommendations

Consider simplifying the enhanced mock repository by removing complex business logic and focusing on basic CRUD operations with configurable responses. Move business logic testing to integration tests or service-specific unit tests.

Standardize error handling patterns across all mock implementations to consistently use the `SetError(operation, error)` pattern that's already implemented in the enhanced mock repository.
