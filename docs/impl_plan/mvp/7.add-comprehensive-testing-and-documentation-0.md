I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

The codebase has excellent foundations with clean architecture and event-driven design, but significant testing gaps exist. Current tests use consistent patterns (table-driven, testify assertions, proper mocking) but only cover 3 of 10 modules. The mocking infrastructure is well-designed but missing key external API mocks. Integration test utilities exist but aren't fully utilized. The build system has basic test targets but lacks comprehensive integration testing and coverage reporting. The README is outdated and doesn't reflect the modular architecture.

### Approach

I'll create a comprehensive test suite with unit tests for all modules using table-driven patterns, integration tests for end-to-end flows, and proper mocking of external dependencies. The approach focuses on:

- **Complete Unit Test Coverage**: Add missing tests for 7 modules (scheduler, events, common, handlers, routes, logger, config, database) using consistent table-driven patterns
- **External API Mocking**: Create proper mocks for Telegram Bot API and Gemma API using interfaces and httptest
- **Integration Test Infrastructure**: Implement end-to-end flow testing using testcontainers for database and real event bus
- **Build System Enhancement**: Update Makefile with proper test targets and add missing dependencies
- **Documentation Refresh**: Completely rewrite README.md with modular architecture documentation and testing instructions

The implementation maintains existing test quality while filling coverage gaps and establishing robust testing infrastructure.

### Reasoning

I analyzed the current test coverage across all modules and found that while chatbot, llm, and nudge modules have comprehensive tests, 7 modules are completely missing tests. I examined the existing mocking infrastructure and identified gaps in external API mocking, particularly for Telegram and HTTP clients. I mapped out the event-driven architecture flows that need integration testing and assessed the current build system capabilities. This analysis revealed the need for comprehensive unit tests, better external API mocking, proper integration test infrastructure, and updated documentation.

## Proposed File Changes

### go.mod(MODIFY)

Add missing testing dependencies to support comprehensive test suite:
