# Event-Driven Communication Implementation - Remaining Tasks

## Implementation Status Summary

Based on analysis of the current codebase and implementation progress for Plan 5 (Connect modules with event-driven communication), here's what has been completed and what remains to be finished.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED ITEMS

### Core Event Types and Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **internal/events/types.go**: Added all new event types
  - `TaskListResponse` with fields: Event, UserID, ChatID, Tasks, TotalCount, HasMore
  - `TaskActionResponse` with fields: Event, UserID, ChatID, TaskID, Action, Success, Message
  - `TaskSummary` struct for lightweight task representation
  - All corresponding topic constants added

### Service Event Handlers
- ‚úÖ **internal/nudge/service.go**: All new event handlers implemented
  - `handleTaskListRequested()` - retrieves and sends task lists
  - `handleTaskActionRequested()` - processes task actions (done, delete, snooze)
  - Event subscriptions properly set up in `setupEventSubscriptions()`

- ‚úÖ **internal/chatbot/service.go**: All response handlers implemented
  - `handleTaskListResponse()` - formats and sends task lists to users
  - `handleTaskActionResponse()` - sends action confirmations/errors
  - `handleTaskCreated()` - sends task creation confirmations
  - Event subscriptions properly set up
  - Updated `handleTaskParsed()` to delegate to TaskCreated events

### Main Server Integration
- ‚úÖ **cmd/server/main.go**: Event bus integration completed
  - Event bus health check and subscription validation
  - Startup delay for service initialization
  - Graceful shutdown with event bus cleanup
  - Proper timeout handling

### Utility and Support Files
- ‚úÖ **internal/events/integration.go**: Complete integration utilities
  - `EventFlowValidator` with flow testing methods
  - `EventFlowMonitor` for runtime monitoring
  - Helper functions for testing and validation

- ‚úÖ **internal/mocks/event_mocks.go**: Comprehensive mock implementations
  - `MockEventBus` with full functionality
  - Testing helper methods and factory functions
  - Assertion helpers for testing

- ‚úÖ **internal/common/event_utils.go**: Common event utilities
  - `EventPublisher` with retry mechanisms
  - `EventValidator` for validation
  - `EventMetrics` for monitoring
  - Helper and transformation functions

### Test Infrastructure (Partially Complete)
- ‚úÖ **internal/nudge/service_test.go**: Comprehensive nudge service tests
- ‚úÖ **internal/chatbot/service_test.go**: Chatbot service tests
- ‚úÖ **internal/llm/service_test.go**: LLM service tests
- ‚úÖ **integration_test.go**: End-to-end integration tests

## ‚ùå REMAINING ISSUES TO FIX

### Critical Test Infrastructure Issues

#### 1. Import Cycle Problems (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Multiple import cycles preventing tests from running
- `internal/chatbot` ‚Üî `internal/mocks` cycle
- `internal/llm` ‚Üî `internal/mocks` cycle  
- `internal/nudge` ‚Üî `internal/mocks` cycle

**Solution Needed**:
- Move service-specific mocks to their respective packages (like we did with `internal/nudge/mock_repository.go`)
- Remove circular dependencies between service packages and central mocks package
- Create interface-based mocking within each service package

#### 2. Test Compilation Errors (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Multiple compilation errors in test files
- Undefined `mocks` references in service tests
- Unused variables in test functions
- Type mismatches in mock interfaces

**Solution Needed**:
- Fix all undefined references to mocks
- Clean up unused variables in test functions
- Ensure all mock interfaces match their corresponding service interfaces

#### 3. Mock Implementation Consistency (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Inconsistent mock implementations across services
- Some services use local mocks, others reference central mocks
- Different mock patterns in different test files

**Solution Needed**:
- Standardize mock implementation patterns
- Ensure all services have consistent testing approaches
- Verify all mock methods implement correct interfaces

### Testing Completeness Issues

#### 4. Integration Test Coverage (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Integration tests created but may not cover all scenarios
- Complete user journey testing
- Error handling scenarios
- Concurrent event processing
- Event persistence and replay

**Solution Needed**:
- Verify integration tests actually run and pass
- Add missing test scenarios for edge cases
- Ensure proper cleanup between integration tests

#### 5. Service-Specific Test Gaps (LOW PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Some service methods may not have complete test coverage
- Edge case handling in event processors
- Error scenarios and recovery
- Performance under load

**Solution Needed**:
- Review test coverage for all service methods
- Add tests for error conditions
- Include performance and stress testing

## üîß IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### Step 1: Fix Import Cycles (CRITICAL)
1. Create local mock implementations in each service package
2. Remove references to central `internal/mocks` package from service tests
3. Update test imports to use only local dependencies

### Step 2: Fix Compilation Errors (CRITICAL)
1. Fix all undefined `mocks` references in test files
2. Remove unused variables in test functions
3. Ensure all type signatures match between mocks and interfaces

### Step 3: Verify Test Execution (HIGH)
1. Run individual service tests to ensure they compile and pass
2. Run integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality
3. Fix any runtime errors or test failures

### Step 4: Complete Test Coverage (MEDIUM)
1. Add missing test scenarios for edge cases
2. Verify error handling in all event processors
3. Add performance and concurrency tests

### Step 5: Documentation and Cleanup (LOW)
1. Update documentation to reflect completed implementation
2. Clean up any temporary or debug code
3. Ensure consistent code style and patterns

## üìä COMPLETION ESTIMATE
