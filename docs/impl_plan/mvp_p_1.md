I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

I analyzed the repository structure and found it's currently empty except for documentation. The project requires a complete Go backend setup following Clean Architecture principles for a Telegram bot called NudgeBot. The documentation shows this is a task management bot that will use Gin, PostgreSQL, and Docker. I need to create the entire project structure from scratch including go.mod, directory structure, basic server setup, database connection, and Docker configuration.

### Approach

I'll initialize a complete Go project following Clean Architecture patterns as specified in the documentation. The setup will include:

- Initialize `go.mod` with proper module name
- Create Clean Architecture directory structure (`cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `api/`, `configs/`, `test/`)
- Set up basic `main.go` with Gin server
- Implement PostgreSQL connection with proper configuration
- Add environment configuration loading using Viper
- Create Docker setup with multi-stage build
- Implement basic health check endpoint
- Include proper error handling and logging structure
- Follow the coding standards outlined in `rules.md`

### Reasoning

I explored the repository structure and found it contains only documentation files. I read the rules.md and mvp_prd.md files to understand the project requirements, coding standards, and architecture patterns. The documentation clearly outlines this is a Telegram bot project that needs Clean Architecture implementation with Go, Gin, PostgreSQL, and Docker setup.
